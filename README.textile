h1. SmokeSignals

SmokeSignals is an implementation of Lisp-style conditions and restarts as a Ruby library.  If you're unfamiliar with conditions and restarts, check out the chapter from "Practical Common Lisp":http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/beyond-exception-handling-conditions-and-restarts.html.

SmokeSignals is different because:

* conditions are not errors (although they can be)
* signaling a condition does not unravel the stack (although it can)
* conditions can be handled multiple times at different levels of the call stack (or not at all)
* restarts can be established at any level in the call stack, not just where the condition is signaled
* implementation of signaling, handling, and restarting is completely hidden. (The only possible exception to this is a design decision which allows @ensure@ blocks to work, making this usable with real side-effectful programs.)

h2. Usage

See the tests.  Usage may change as I discover better syntax.

h2. Requirements

Ruby 1.8 or 1.9.  No other gem dependencies.

h2. Running Tests

pre. ruby test/smoke_signals_test.rb

h2. Special Thanks

This was inspired in part by "dynamic_vars":https://github.com/robdimarco/dynamic_vars, an implementation of thread-local dynamic bindings in Ruby!
